					<span>
						I am Atakan,a highly motivated AI Engineer and Student 
						with a strong passion for data-driven development. With 
						2+ years of experience in full-stack development, I 
						have developed and maintained AI models and worked with 
						data to improve systems and products. I have expertise 
						in machine learning models such as Torch-based Models 
						(YOLOv5, YOLOv7) and TensorFlow-based Models (LSTM, 
						ImageNet, ResNet50), as well as Python and its 
						frameworks and libraries, such as Django. I am also 
						proficient in JavaScript and the Web, particularly with
						Vue and its ecosystem. As a great communicator,I excel
						in playing a lead role in projects by being the 
						bridge between clients and developers and responding 
						quickly and effectively to any issues that may arise. 
						I am now seeking a challenging role that leverages my 
						expertise in Artificial Intelligence and communication, 
						and allows me to grow further.

				<div class="list-card">
					<div>
						<h3>Optimized Object Detection Model</h3>
						<span>
							Created a new Machine Learning model 
							to perform the same task as a model hosted 
							on cloud, integrated the model into the 
							backend and improved accuracy in double 
							digits, reducing the cloud costs significantly,
							providing a cheaper, faster and better alternative.
						</span>
						<h3>Expanded User Flow Options</h3>
						<span>
							Enhanced the functionality of a B2C (Business-to-consumer) 
							front-end application by developing a desktop flow and a 
							B2B (Business-to-business) flow for each device-specific flow.
							Utilised a stable routing library so the different flows 
							could be achieved with the minimal amount of modification to 
							the backend, reducing the development time and the potential 
							risk of a disturbing a large-scale application.
						</span>
						<h3>Resolved Critical Production Issues</h3>
						<span>
							Demonstrated expertise in debugging by quickly identifying 
							and fixing production issues, no matter the day or the time. 
							Responded promptly and as soon as possible to issues, either 
							resolving them myself, discovering the cause of the issue or 
							finding the right person to do so. Helped ensure that the 
							product remained stable and functional at all times.
						</span>
						<h3>Optimized Legacy Codebase</h3>
						<span>
							Refactored complex and lengthy legacy methods by dividing 
							them into shorter, more modular methods. Resulted in a more 
							organized and maintainable codebase that is easier to work 
							with and build upon.
						</span>
						<h3>Improved Project Documentation</h3>
						<span>
							Improved the development process by leading and assisting 
							with the improvement of READMEs. Standardized local development 
							and made onboarding new developers easier.
