					<span>
						I'm <strong>Atakan</strong>, a highly motivated <strong>AI Researcher & Engineer</strong> ,
                        with a Bachelor's Degree in AI from the <strong>University of Groningen</strong>. 
                      	With 2+ years of experience in the industry, I have developed and maintained 
                        AI models for various tasks, ranging from Object Detection to Language Modeling. 
                        <br></br>
                        I also am a proficient Full-Stack Developer, with great deal of experience with Django
                        and Vue.js, which I leverage to build the frameworks and interfaces I use for research
                        and prototyping. 
                        <strong>Currently I'm working on multi-chained function calling with LLMs</strong>,
                        which you can check in detail <a href="https://github.com/AtakanTekparmak/EasyFNC">here</a>.
                    	<br></br>
                        As a <strong>great communicator</strong>, I excel in situations where I have a lead role, guiding the 
                        trajectory of the project and/or research, giving suggestions and organising the 
                        processes. I am now seeking a role in which I will work with my true passion, AI, 
                        and in which I will use my both technical and non-technical skills to contribute to 
                        the field of AI, and if possible, open source software.
